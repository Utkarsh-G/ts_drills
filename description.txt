Drills need to cover

Arrays
Numbers
Strings

fetch from API
Promises
Async / Await

Drill 1:

Given an input array and a smaller array of indices, return an array of arrays, where the subarrays are the 3 elements starting at each of the indices in the indices array.

Drill 2:

Given two strings, find if one is a substring of the other. If it is, return all indices at which the substring occurs.


Drill 3:

Return the squarert of the cube of a number, to 2 decimal points, tamped down to 10 if lower than 10.


Drill 4:

Fetch a pokemon from the pokemon API, then wait for user to type y or anything else before fetching the next one. After 10 such pokemon, publish a list of all the ones that the user typed 'y' in.


Drill 5:

fetch 10 pokemon serially, then fetch them parallely, then compare the timing of each.
